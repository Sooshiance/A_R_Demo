# Solving Problems

In this repo, I will solve <a href="https://codeforces.com/">CodeForces</a> website daily.

I will solve problems in Python version 3 or Java version 17 or C version 13.2.

For each problem, there should be a separate folder because, maybe someone likes to write a document for that problem or
he wants to solve it with multiple languages.

You can solve them with any programming languages that you prefer.

For easy access and quick viewing of problems, I will make an anchor tag for any problem that had been solved in here.

If you found any issues with any solutions, send me a comment.

THANKS.
