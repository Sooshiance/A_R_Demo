You are given two integers x and y.

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y, followed by the maximum of x and y.

Input The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y (0≤x,y≤9).

Output For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x  and y, followed by the maximum of x and y.
